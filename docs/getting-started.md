# 🚀 Getting Started with LogeekMind v2.0

LogeekMind has been rebuilt with a modern, scalable architecture. The frontend is now a Next.js application, and it communicates with a separate Python backend.

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend:** A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.
- **Backend:** A Python server (using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)) that handles all AI processing and business logic.
- **Database & Auth:** [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) is used for user authentication and database storage.
